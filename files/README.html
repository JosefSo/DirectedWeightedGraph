This software deals with the graphic realization of weighted and directed graphs. </br>As part of implementing the graphs we implemented Node, Edge, Graph, and algorithms on the graph.</br>The algorithms we implemented are: finding a central node, finding the shortest route between two nodes and its length, checking if the graph is connected, and finding a solution to the problem of neighboring cities (tsp).</br>
In addition, the software has editing options for the graph, which are adding a node, deleting a node, connecting an edge, and deleting an edge.</br>


You can load graphs from json to decapitate the graphs and save again as a json file.</br>
We will now look at the graphical interface of the software </br>

<b>File Menu</b></br>By clicking <b>Load</b> you can load a graph.</br>By clicking <b>Save</b> the graph will be saved in data folder with the given name.</br>By clicking<b> Exit</b> the program will be closed.</br><img width="100" alt="Screen Shot 2021-11-18 at 0 26 08" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86108478/145414914-2169c8f6-b3c6-4d95-8db2-143b80588c8f.png"></br>

<b>Edit Menu</b></br>By clicking <b>show numbers </b>you can display numbers representing the node id's, and the edge weights,clicking again will remove the numbers.</br>By clicking <b>add node</b> it will be possible to add nodes on the graph (this is possible when this button is bold).</br>By clicking <b>remove node</b> you can remove node given node id.</br>By clicking <b>connect edge</b> you can connect edge with given src and dest that are the id of the start and end node.</br>By clicking <b>remove edge</b> you can also remove edge in the same way of the connection. </br><img width="100" alt="Screen Shot 2021-11-18 at 0 26 08" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86108478/145415876-cd4df199-65ab-46fc-bbc1-ef7fd17bff96.png">

<b>Graph Menu</b></br>By clicking on <b>Is Connected</b> you can check whether the graph is connected, which means that each node has a path for each node.</br>By clicking <b>Center</b> you will find the central node, the one from which the path to the other nodes is minimal,this node will be colored red. </br>By clicking <b>Clear Colors</b> all the colors that have changed in the graph will return to their source.</br>By clicking <b>Clear Graph</b> the graph will be deleted and a blank grapg will be loaded to apply a job.</br><img width="100" alt="Screen Shot 2021-11-18 at 0 26 08" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86108478/145416119-b6776909-bd98-42df-b9d1-d5446c832bc9.png"></br>

.</br><b>Path Menu</b></br>By clicking <b>Shortest Path</B> you can find out what is the shortest path between two nodes by entering their id, the route will be displayed and colored in green, and its length will also be displayed.</br>By clicking<b> TSP</b> and giving a list of nodes as a string of numbers, representing the comma-separated node id will be calculated in the shortest circular path passing through all the nodes. This path will be displayed and colored in green (note that you only use numbers and commas). Example of correct input: "0,1,2,3,4".</br><img width="100" alt="Screen Shot 2021-11-18 at 0 26 08" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86108478/145416329-5a05201a-5fb7-48b1-88e8-1e15987ab656.png">

<b>Help Menu</b></br>By clicking <b>Help</b> you can open this README file to help yourself to use the program</br><img width="200" alt="Screen Shot 2021-11-18 at 0 26 08" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86108478/145416436-499ab5f3-8e16-4212-8bae-f7179ca158e4.png"></br>
