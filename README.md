This OOP project deals with the realization of weighted and directed graphs. It includes a few calculations on the graph via well-known algorithms such as Floyd-Warshall algorithm and Dijkstra algorithm and also it includes the GUI (graphical user interface) to show the graph itself and it's calculations to the user. </br>
As part of implementing the graphs we implemented classes:</br>
 <b>* class Node</br>
 * class Edge</br>
 * class Graph</br>
 * class Geo_Location</br>
 * class GraphAlgorithms</b> (algorithms on the graph)</br>
</br>
The algorithms we implemented are: </br></br>
 ðŸ”¹<b>Center:</b>  finding a central node (node with the minimal sum weight of edges that get out of it to all other nodes). Our algorithm for finding center is based on Floyd-Warshall algorithm that is dynamic programming. The Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm compares all possible paths through the graph between each pair of vertices. It is able to do this with Î˜(|V|^3).Pseudocode for Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm: </br>

After that we have matrix with the shortest paths so to find vertex with the best sum of all shortest path we just sum all of the shortest path from the n-vertex and return vertex with the minimal sum.</br>
 ðŸ”¹<b>Shortest path:</b>  finding the shortest path between two nodes and its length. Our algorithm for finding shortest path is based on Dijkstra algorithm.</br>
 ðŸ”¹<b>Is connected: </b>checking if the graph is connected. Our algorithm for finding if the graph is connected is based on Dijkstra algorithm too (For the first time we used BFS algorithm and it also worked well but found out that we can calculate it with Dijkstra algorithm as well and because Dijkstra was working faster so we prefered it)</br>
ðŸ”¹<b>Tsp</b>:(not real tsp but very close to it):   finding finding the shortest path that goes over all nodes in the graph. Here we used Simulated annealing (SA) Algorithm. Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. </br></br>
In addition, the program has editing options for the graph, which are: add node, delete node, connect edge, and delete edge.</br>


You can load graphs from json to decapitate the graphs and save again as a json file.</br>
We will now look at the graphical interface of the program </br>

<b>File Menu</b></br>By clicking <b>Load</b> you can load a graph.</br>By clicking <b>Save</b> the graph will be saved in data folder with the given name.</br>By clicking<b> Exit</b> the program will be closed.</br><img width="100" alt="Screen Shot 2021-11-18 at 0 26 08" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86108478/145414914-2169c8f6-b3c6-4d95-8db2-143b80588c8f.png"></br>

<b>Edit Menu</b></br>By clicking <b>show numbers </b>you can display numbers representing the node id's, and the edge weights,clicking again will remove the numbers.</br>By clicking <b>add node</b> it will be possible to add nodes on the graph (this is possible when this button is bold).</br>By clicking <b>remove node</b> you can remove node given node id.</br>By clicking <b>connect edge</b> you can connect edge with given src and dest that are the id of the start and end node.</br>By clicking <b>remove edge</b> you can also remove edge in the same way of the connection. </br><img width="100" alt="Screen Shot 2021-11-18 at 0 26 08" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86108478/145415876-cd4df199-65ab-46fc-bbc1-ef7fd17bff96.png">
</br>

<b>Graph Menu</b></br>By clicking on <b>Is Connected</b> you can check whether the graph is connected, which means that each node has a path for each node.</br>By clicking <b>Center</b> you will find the central node, the one from which the path to the other nodes is minimal,this node will be colored red. </br>By clicking on <b>Random Graph</b> you can choose number of nodes, then a new graph with the given number of nodes will be loaded on random locations, every node in the graph will be connected at leat 2 times, one as src and one as dest.</br>By clicking <b>Clear Colors</b> all the colors that have changed in the graph will return to their source.</br>By clicking <b>Clear Graph</b> the graph will be deleted and a blank grapg will be loaded to apply a job.</br><img width="100" alt="Screen Shot 2021-11-18 at 0 26 08" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86108478/145498897-8dacf099-44bc-4dfe-9db5-0c7f7f8b02dc.png"></br>


.</br><b>Path Menu</b></br>By clicking <b>Shortest Path</B> you can find out what is the shortest path between two nodes by entering their id, the route will be displayed and colored in green, and its length will also be displayed.</br>By clicking<b> TSP</b> and giving a list of nodes as a string of numbers, representing the comma-separated node id will be calculated in the shortest circular path passing through all the nodes. This path will be displayed and colored in green (note that you only use numbers and commas). Example of correct input: "0,1,2,3,4".</br><img width="100" alt="Screen Shot 2021-11-18 at 0 26 08" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86108478/145416329-5a05201a-5fb7-48b1-88e8-1e15987ab656.png">

   </br><b>Instructions for running the program:</b></br>
   ðŸ”¹Download the following zip file- 
   [Ex2_jar.zip](https://github.com/SaliSharfman/Ex2_DirectedWeightedGraph/files/7704959/Ex2_jar.zip)

</br>
   ðŸ”¹Extract the files to your computer.</br>
   ðŸ”¹Open CMD.</br>
   ðŸ”¹Cd the directory that you saved the files in.</br>
   ðŸ”¹Write the next command: java -jar Ex2.jar (you can run with a json file argument for example: java -jar Ex2.jar G1.json ).</br>
   ðŸ”¹The GUI of the project will run, a directory named "data" will appear in the directory that you saved the files    in for loading and saving files, if you runned with a json    file argument the graph that you runned will be drawn and saved in data directory, else, a new empty graph will be opened and saved in data dirctory. </br>
   ðŸ”¹ Now you can use the program, edit graphs and run the algorithms.</br>
   <b>Have fun! </B></center>
